Working on this project I felt that it wasn't too bad overall. I had to search around a bit before I found a reasonable JSON file to download. In hindsight I probably could have used an API call to retrieve data and then just written it to a separate file. The conversions were not too challenging as most of the work is already done for us via the Pandas library. I spend some time trying to figure out how best to read the number of rows and columns from a nested JSON object before realizing that I could just flatten it using 'json_normalize'. Additionally, I kept deleting and recreating my database until I realized I could just drop tables if they exist already. In total I felt this was a nice culmination of the material we have been working on up to this point and I feel fairly comfortable moving forward.
